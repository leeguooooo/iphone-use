//! axum HTTP app: auth-gated routes for the WebRTC web client.
//!
//! Routes (contract from `web/index.html`):
//!   * `GET  /phone`       — auth-gated; serves the embedded web client.
//!   * `GET  /setup`       — auth-gated; serves the live iPhone connection guide.
//!   * `GET  /login`       — password form.
//!   * `POST /login`       — password check → set signed `phone_session` cookie.
//!   * `GET  /logout`      — clear the cookie.
//!   * `GET  /turn-creds`  — auth-gated; `{iceServers:[...]}` (STUN + env TURN).
//!   * `GET  /ws`          — auth-gated WebSocket; daemon-offerer signaling.
//!   * `GET  /`            — redirect to `/phone`.
//!
//! Auth: the `phone_session` cookie value is an HMAC session token minted by
//! [`core::auth::make_token`] and verified by [`core::auth::check_token`] using
//! the daemon secret. When no password is configured, all routes are open (LAN
//! dev mode) — the gate short-circuits to "authed".
//!
//! Security headers (v1 parity): `Cache-Control: no-store`, `X-Frame-Options:
//! DENY`, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` on every response.
