# Regression test for the ad-hoc signing order in install.sh and sign.sh.
#
# The bug this pins down: `iphone-use` is the app bundle's MAIN executable, so
# `codesign --sign - .../MacOS/iphone-use` is treated as signing the *bundle*
# and validates nested code on the way. With `iphone-use-mcp` still only
# linker-signed at that moment, codesign fails:
#
#   .../MacOS/iphone-use: code object is not signed at all
#   In subcomponent: .../MacOS/iphone-use-mcp
#
# install.sh runs under `set -e`, so that aborted the whole install and rolled
# it back — every published release was uninstallable on any machine that took
# the ad-hoc path, which is all of them, because CI ships a bundle whose outer
# signature is absent and whose binaries carry only a linker-signed ad-hoc one.
#
# Unit tests cannot catch this: it only reproduces against a real two-binary
# .app on a real macOS codesign. So this test builds one and runs the actual
# signer functions from the actual scripts.
#
# macOS only; skips cleanly elsewhere.
